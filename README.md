Going into the project these were my goals:
I want to create an informational database to store and display request information regarding my definitive top NBA players. As a user I want to be able to find the shoe preferences, stats and sponsorships of NBA players. As a user I want to be able to find the brand name of the shoe that any given NBA player wears. As a user I want to be able to create players to add to my database and also update existing ones.

I ended up created a database of players from a back end that can be displayed and interacted with through the front end.
